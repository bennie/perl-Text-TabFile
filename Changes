Revision history for Perl extension Text::TabFile.

1.10  2006/06/31

	Provided non-capitalized method names to match Perl style as suggested
	 by CPAN rating comments. Historic "Java-style" method names still
	 function.

	Corrected POD and docs for new method names, version changes, other
	 grammatical errors and removed accidental references to TabFile.pm

	Added two basic test scripts for historic and current method calls
	 that parse a provided tab file.

	Added initialization checks on exported methods to avoid superfluous
	 warnings generated when -w is used.

	Added credit to PetBlvd (http://www.petblvd.com) for the sponsorship
	 of further development.

1.00  2004/04/02

	Full copyright and license information.

	Sufficient usage to warrent a release of 1.0.

0.80  2004/01/15

	Derived from HMS tool Util::TabFile (1.9 2003/11/05)

	Constructed to instance Text::Delimiter properly.

	Module made to pass strict.
